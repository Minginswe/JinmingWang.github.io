My profile
Basics
My name is Jinming Wang, I am from China and currently studying in Sweden. My English is not good, but I have the motivations to improve it, hopefully I will make friends and get my skills better. That's it lol
My personality
I am quite introvert, and when talking to people I will feel nervous, especillay the people that I am unfamiliar with.
However, I am trying to overcome that.
WHY NMD?
To be honest, I do not really why I chose New media design as my major, actully I have ever taken an university in my 
country, my major was electronic and information engineering, it was so boring, then I dropped out of it , and I did something else after that. 

My hobbies
I like taking photos( I should have said photography, but my photos do not look professional).

I extremely like watching anime, so I put several animes that I very like down below. ( Also, I found out anime is like a 
bridge to make connections with people who are also interested in anime, so if you have the similat hobbies as mine, 
feel free to talk to me)
Anime
