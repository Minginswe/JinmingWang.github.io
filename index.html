                My name is Jinming Wang, I am from China and currently studying in Sweden. My English is not good, but I
                have the motivations to improve it, hopefully I will make friends and get my skills better. That's it
                lol

                I am quite introvert, and when talking to people I will feel nervous, especillay the people that I am
                unfamiliar with.However, I am trying to overcome that.

                To be honest, I do not really why I chose New <br> media design as my major, actully I have ever
                <br> taken an
                university in my
                country, my major <br> was electronic and information engineering, <br> it was so boring, then I
                dropped out of it , <br>
                and I did something else after that.

                I like taking photos( I should have said <br> photography, but my photos do not look<br> professional).
                I extremely like watching anime,<br>  ( Also, I
                found
                our anime is like a <br>
                bridge to make connections with people <br> who are also interested in anime, so if <br> you have the
                similat
                hobbies as mine, <br>
                feel free to talk to me)
